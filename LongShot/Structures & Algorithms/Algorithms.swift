/// Implementation of Insertion Sort Algorithm using a generic Array
///
/// Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list)
/// one item at a time
///
/// It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms
///
/// Efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic sorting algorithms
/// More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i.e., O(n2))
/// algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort
///
/// Stable; i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys
/// In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space
///
/// How it works: Algorithm traverses the list of elements from start to end
/// For every element on the left side of the array (trversing back to start)
/// It will check every element and swap the element if it is smaller
///

/// Usage:
///
/// var testArrayInsertionSort = [8, 2, 5, 3, 11, 4, 6]
///
/// insertionSort(&testArrayInsertionSort)
/// print("\(testArrayInsertionSort)") -> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11
///
///                 -> Traverse every element left to right
///                     5
///             2 - 8 -   - 3 - 11 - 4 - 6
///
///                  <- Compare and swap right to left
///

func insertionSort<T: Comparable>(_ array: inout [T]) {
    
    /// Exit condition where array has at least 2 elements
    guard array.count >= 2 else {
        return
    }
    
    /// Traverse every element left to right
    for traverseIndex in 1...array.count {
        /// Compare and swap right to left
        for elementIndex in (1..<traverseIndex).reversed() {
            if array[elementIndex] < array[elementIndex - 1] {
                array.swapAt(elementIndex, elementIndex - 1)
            }
        }
    }
    
}


/// Implementation of Merge Sort Algorithm using a generic Array
///
/// Merge sort is a s an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm
///
/// Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm
///
/// In sorting n objects, merge sort has an average and worst-case performance of O(n log n)
///
/// Merge sort is more efficient than quicksort for some types of lists
/// if the data to be sorted can only be efficiently accessed sequentially
///
/// How it works: Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
/// Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element
/// Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.
///

/// Usage:
///
/// var testArrayMergeSort = [8, 2, 5, 3, 11, 4, 6]
///
/// let sortedArray = mergeSort(testArrayMergeSort)
/// print("Sorted \(sortedArray)") -> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11
///
///      ->  Divide array into pieces and small chunks until it is single element
///
///             8 - 2 - 5 - 3    11 - 4 - 6 - 1
///             8 - 2   5 - 3
///                 8 - 2
///
///      ->  Merge them back by sorting

    /// Exit condition where array has at least 2 elements

    }
    
    /// Find the middle point
    let middleIndex = array.count / 2

/// Implementation of Binart Search Algorithm in swift using Range
///
/// Binary search, also known as half-interval search,[1] logarithmic search,[2] or binary chop,[3]
/// is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array
///
/// Binary search is a divide and conquer algorithm which can search very fast in SORTED LIST
///
/// Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making O(log n) comparisons
///
/// Binary Search is a efficient searching algorithm
/// So in some cases it might be a good practice to sort first and use binary search
///
/// How it works: Conceptually, a binary search works as follows:
/// Binary search begins by comparing the middle element of the array with the target value
/// The target value matches the middle element, its position in the array is returned
/// The target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array
/// The target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the upper half of the array

/// Usage:
///
/// var testArrayBinarySearch = [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
///
/// let searchResult = binarySearch(testArrayBinarySearch, for: 6)
///
/// if let result = searchResult {
///     print("\(result)")
/// }
///
///      ->  Divide array into pieces and small chunks and choose left or right side recursively
